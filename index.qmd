Moves-UP aims to support children to develop their motor skills as a key part of their overall learning and development.

Motor difficulties are extremely common among school aged children and can have a detrimental impact on academic performance, social interactions, and overall health and well-being.

We work with schools, health care practitioners and families to provide evidence-informed interventions to support children with motor difficulties.
